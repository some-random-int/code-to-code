# code-to-code
We want to look into the domain of machine translation of programming languages. With this project, we aim to train a pre-trained model in for the translation of Java code and C# code. After that, we will build our own model from scratch (using PyTorch or TensorFlow). Both approaches will be evaluated at the end.
